# Project-Euler-Python

This is a repository that aims to solve every problem posted on Project Euler in Python3. 

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Each problem will contain its own directory with a .py file as the code and a .md file to explain how the code works. If you see any way the code could be improved for any of the projects, please tell me. Every .py file will also have a timer to time how long the program takes to run.


Thank you!
